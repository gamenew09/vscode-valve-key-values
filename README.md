# Valve Key Values README
Valve Key Values is a file format used by Source Engine and Steam. This extension aims to make the process of making these types of files easier.

There is also support for Valve Project Creator files.

## Valve Key Values (VKV)
Valve Key Values currently only has simple syntax highlighting. In the future for the files that use Valve Key Values, there will be possibly Intelisense with them.

## Valve Project Creator (VPC)
Valve Project Creator support includes the following
 - Syntax Highlighting
 - Basic Intelisense (will be improving)
 - Basic Go To Definition for Includes (Macros are kind of supported)
